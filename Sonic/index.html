         <div>
             <p>I have thought about utilising my skills for along time now. I have only ever (for my ownvsetup) had all my gear in my bedroom, and its been like this for years.
              I have made hundreds of unfinished songs and loops on different DAW's. I first started my journey with a bit of money so I bought Reason 5 second hand and got myself a second hand Mac Book Pro, with an M-Audio
              Keystation Pro 88 MIDI controller I had from before, eventually buying Maschine MK1 (also second hand) with the licence to the software as well. From there, I was just looking
              at making sounds using the soft synths in Reason, notknowing what to do, but being really happy with the first sound I made which sounded like a distorted guitar synth with the pitch rising over time (sounded really cool)
              I bought an online  Reason Learning course as videos and started to learn it from there. At this point I was dish washing as my job around 25 years old. I remember one day looking up a shared space in
              Kingslang (inner city suburb of Auckland) called Project Studio's, sort in hope that I could intern there and learn.
              One thing led to another in the conversation and I started paying for my internship from a cool guy named Rahu.
              And this is where it all began.
