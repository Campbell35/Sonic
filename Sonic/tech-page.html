         <h3>La Trinity, Korg</h3>
         <p>The Korg Trinity is my all in one infinitely palleted synthesizer/sequencer/Out Of The Box/Sample playback workstation.
         A lot to say, but it is a very powerful device. In termes or workflow it's a keyboard.
         It has MIDI as well (similar to a USB keyboard just with a different older connection type)
         so can trigger plugins in your computer DAW too, making it quite versitile in both realms.

         </p>
     

         <p>I have been close to selling this and even did but the sale fell through, and glad my Dad told me to keep it.
            In my setup, this workstation acts as the first got to for sound  creation as you can just power it on and 
            make a beat or looped song within it, so it's a fast access for unleashing one's patches, half of which were programmed,
            the other half of the sounds I have yet to synthesise in there but I have them ready in WAV file format
            (so stay tuned for some cool sounds from many different styles of synthesis + other sounds).
